                  The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained,
                  unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish,
                  restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you
                  suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free,
                  and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be
                  hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will
                  find fault both with gods and men.

                  Of all things which wisdom provides to make life entirely
                  happy, much the greatest is the possession of friendship. It
                  is not so much our friends' help that helps us, as the
                  confidence of their help.

                  But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own,
                  and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one
                  will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find
                  fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing
                  against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no
                  enemies, and you not be harmed.

                  Remember that following desire promises the attainment of that
                  of which you are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding
                  that to which you are averse. However, he who fails to obtain
                  the object of his desire is disappointed, and he who incurs
                  the object of his aversion wretched. If, then, you confine
                  your aversion to those objects only which are contrary to the
                  natural use of your faculties, which you have in your own
                  control, you will never incur anything to which you are
                  averse. But if you are averse to sickness, or death, or
                  poverty, you will be wretched.

                  But, for the present, totally suppress desire: for, if you
                  desire any of the things which are not in your own control,
